# Classes

### Class Members
- structure class Point{}
- Fields 
- strict property initialization
- readonly - prevent  assignment outside constructor
- constructors - function for initialization, overloadided
- super calls 
- methods
- getter/ setters
- index signatures

### Class Heritage
- oops features
- implement clauses - 
- extends
## visibility
    - public - default visibility , can be accessed from anywhere.
    - since default , not needed to specify it, can be done so to prevent readablity reason.
    - protected
    - visible to only subclasses.
## Static Members
    - members assiciated with class itself, not of instances
    - can use ppp modifiers
    - are inherited
    - no static classes
    - static blocks - 
## Generic Classes
    -
## Parameter Properties
    - created with contructor, by adding access modifier inside the constructor("")
## Class Expressions
    - similar to class definitions, execept assighment and no name needed.
## Constructor Signatures
    - 
## Abstract classes
    - class me be abstract
    - method, field dosnt have implementation
    - must exist within class, cannot instantiated
## Relationship bw classes
